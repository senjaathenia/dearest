        <span>Thank you for being with me, thank you for always accepting both my flaws and strengths, thank you for all the things you've given me, whether it's gifts, warmth, affection, and attention. I’m sorry if I sometimes still misbehave, if I don’t always listen, I’m sorry for making you upset and causing you trouble. A thousand apologies and thank-yous might not be enough to express my gratitude and regret for everything, but I want you to know that even though our story hasn’t been long, my love hasn’t faded at all; in fact, it’s only grown stronger. I can accept all your flaws and strengths, I love you because you are you, I love everything about you, so don’t worry that I’ll ever leave you—it won’t happen (unless I die). Let’s make many memories together, create many new chapters, let’s stay together with love and care for each other. I truly love you.</span>
